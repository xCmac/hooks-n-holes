I'm building a game (again)!

If you're an Overwatch player, like me, you might be familiar with the 12 Hogs 1 Hole custom game. It's a mini game where all players are Roadhogs, and the goal is to send your opponents into a hole in the middle of the map. It's a very popular custom game, and one of my favorites.

I like playing this so much that I've decided to build it myself. The current plan is for the MVP to have 3 different maps, and both a solo and team death match mode. Here are a few incredibly rough sketches of how I imagine it to look like. 

[Insert photos here]

The players' objective will be to hook opponents into the hole as many times as possible during a game. The player with the most points wins. 

The goal is to get this game into steam early access. Stay tuned for more updates as development progresses!
